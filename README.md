## Overview

To provide additional pract writing JavaScript functions to solve a specific task, you will be required to complete one code challenge per day during weeks: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 & 8. Totaling 30 challenges.

These code challenges are considered deliverables, and thus 80% of them must be completed in combination with other deliverable homework/assignments in order to receive a Certificate of Completion.

You may choose to do more than one per day, or none at all - just don't fall too far behind!

## Getting Started

- Fork and Clone this repository
- Each day, open the repo in VS Code and work in the `challenges.js` file

## Instructions

- All challenges have one or more tests that run when the `run-tests-by-opening-in-browser.html` file is opened in the browser. 

- By default, Jasmine (the testing framework) will run the tests in random order. To change this, click on the **Options** button at the top-right and uncheck the *run tests in random order* checkbox.

- Solve the challenges by writing functions in the `challenges.js` file only.  **DO NOT MODIFY ANY OTHER FILE.**

- Each code challenge requires writing a **single function** to solve.

- Be sure to name the function **exactly** as specified by the challenge.

- The default display shows only the challenges that are failing. To see an overall summary of all tests, click the "**Spec List**" link.

- After solving a challenge, be sure to check the solution(s) contained in `solutions.js`. If multiple solutions are provided, they are typically shown in increasing order of "elegance".

## Submission Guidelines

- Your instructors will be checking your progress from time-to-time. As you solve the challenges, add and commit your work, and `git push origin main`.  This pushes the updates to your fork.
- At the end of the immersive, we will have you make one pull request on the main repo in the org using the [PR Guidelines](https://github.com/SEI-R-1-25/template_pull_request).
